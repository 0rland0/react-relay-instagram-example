### 2. Configure app data endpoint

Open `src/app.js` and paste your endpoint to the following line:

```js
Relay.injectNetworkLayer(
  new Relay.DefaultNetworkLayer('https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/__PROJECT_ID__')
);
```

### 3. Configure build schema endpoint

Open `package.json` and insert your endpoint in the following line:


```json
  "graphql": {
    "request": {
      "url": "https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/__PROJECT_ID__"
    }
  },
```

This step is needed in order to support Relay. More info can be found here: [babel-plugin-react-relay](https://github.com/graphcool/babel-plugin-react-relay).
